        <h2>Emus of Pass St Roundabout</h2>
        <p>
            During the reconstruction of the Pass St roundabout next to Adams Store,<br/>
            the City of Greater Geraldton removed the metalic emus from the<br/>
            roundabout due to safety concerns, yet residents would like to see<br/>
            their return.

        <p>
            The City of Greater Geraldton has proposed to construct a roundabout<br/>
            in Utakarra that connects Flores Road, Horwood Road, and Alexander<br/>
            Street, replacing the two T intersections.
